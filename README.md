# polarPcolor
polarPcolor draws a pseudocolor plot in polar coordinates with a polar grid.



polarPcolor aims to represent a pseudocolour plot in polar coordinates, with a radial grid to allow an easy lecture of the data. It is well suited for Plan Position Indicator (PPI) scan for radar or lidar for example [1]. A similar function is available in ref. [2], which propose a visualization in 3D.
